Delight is a JS library intended to assist with musical analysis and composition strictly for the Western Twelve Equal Tone Temperment system.

Concessions are being made for the sake of simplicity

Caveats:

- the concepts and termonology used are jazz and pop music theory centric (use at your own inconvenience for apps with classical music in mind)
- compound intervals (13th, 14th, etc) may be represented as simple intervals (2nd, 3rd)
- scales / modes will be limited to pentatonic, heptatonic, chromatic, and bebop (probably)
- double accidentals are purposefully avoided, as a result of this, the list of scales / modes considered valid do not include them
- due to the terminology surrounding western music theory being unnecessarily convoluted, this library will take time, contributions are welcome!
